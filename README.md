# macOS Setup!

> A shell script to set up a macOS machine for design and development.

Safe to run multiple times on the same machine. It installs, upgrades, or skips
packages based on what is already installed on the machine.


## Install

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in ~/dev/setup),
the mac script will automate the process with prompts.

`git clone git@github.com/adsric/macos-setup.git && cd macos-setup`

**Run the script:**

`sh macos.sh`

<sub>Just follow the prompts and youâ€™ll be fine. Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal ðŸ‘Œ</sub>

**Run the script with a log:**

`sh macos.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/setup.log`

:warning: **warning:** I advise against running [this macos script](macos.sh) unless you understand what itâ€™s doing to your computer.

:warning: **warning:** It is highly recommended to run the script regularly to keep your computer up to date.

## The setup

The process will install:

It should take less than 20 minutes to install (depends on your machine).


## Known Issues

Cask does not recognize applications installed outside of Homebrew Cask â€“ in the case that the script fails, you can either remove the application from the install list or uninstall the application causing the failure and try again.


## Debugging

Your last setup run will be saved to ~/setup.log (if you chose to run the script with a log). Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a new GitHub Issue. Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
